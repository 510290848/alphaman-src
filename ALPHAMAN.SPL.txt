1.  MUTATIONS
All characters have 1 Physical and 1 Mental Mutation.

  A. Physical Mutations
     1.  Acidic Saliva
         This mutation can be used every 8 rounds.  You can spit a caustic
         substance at a distance, although you hit more easily and do slightly
         more damage at close range.  You do 4 dice damage, where the dice
         size is given by 3 + (your level - distance between you & target)/2
     2.  Blood Structure Change
         Your Constitution is raised to somewhere between 19 and 23.  You
         consequently have more hit points, and you take much-reduced damage
         from poison (half what a character without Blood Structure Change
         would take, even with the same Constitution).  You also are less
         likely to suffer lingering stat losses from poison, and recover from
         sickness attacks (like the skunk) three times faster.
     3.  Electrical Generation
         You can generate electrical currents on your skin which will damage
         any creature touching you during the round used (touching means the
         creature scores a successful hit on you with a contact-attack like
         a bite, but not no-touch attacks like radiation or mental attacks.
         The damage done to each creature is 2 dice of size (4 + your level).
         This is extremely useful against swarms like Killer Bees, Locusts.
     4.  Foul Musk
         You can generate a cloud of stinking gas that causes creatures to
         flee from you.  You will occasionally make creatures sick, causing
         them to barf (during which time they are mostly defenseless from
         attack).  This is effective as a defense, particularly when you get
         surrounded by beasties.
     5.  Heightened Dexterity
         Your Dexterity is raised to somewhere in the range of 19-23.  Your
         Armor Class is much improved, and you can hit significantly easier
         with range weapons (even range tech weapons).
     6.  Heightened Endurance
         You have more hit points than most characters, can carry more than
         twice the weight with the same encumberance, you grow hungry less
         quickly, and can endure time underwater much longer.
     7.  Heightened Speed
         You can temporarily double your speed, allowing you more attacks and
         enabling you to outrun many creatures if you're in a bind.  A very
         useful mutation, especially if coupled with an attack-type mental
         mutation such as Life Leech or Cryogenics.
     8.  Heightened Strength
         Your Strength is raised to somewhere in the range of 19-23.  You
         consequently do more damage and hit more often with contact weapons.
         You can also carry more stuff, and have an easier time getting out
         of spiderwebs, breaking down doors, etc.
     9.  Heightened Vision
         You can see more clearly and in a broader EM spectrum, giving you
         minor bonuses to hit with weapons, allowing you to see further in
         darkness, and allowing you to look over long ranges to see, for
         example, whether there are any goodies in nearby regions of the map.
         You can also see radiation zones and avoid them.  With this mutation,
         one can usually skip the Munsters' Castle, since spotting the hidden
         castle of the Grinch is relatively straightforward.
     10. Laser Generation
         Every 10 rounds you can fire a laser beam.  This beam can strike a
         single target at a fairly long range, hitting often and doing 3 dice
         damage, with dice size given by 5 + (your level)/3
     11. Poison Claws
         These do very irregular damage, occasionally only doing 1-4 points,
         but capable of doing up to 10-40 when you are at 10th level.
         Although their range is short, they have several advantages.  If you
         miss, they are immediately available for use again.  They occasionally
         make the creature hit nauseous (barf).  It is also useful to have a
         readily-available non-kinetic attack form for those creatures which
         take only 1/3 damage from kinetic attacks (like Zapweed, Rot Fungus,
         Slugs).
     12. Quills
         Quills provide protection from creatures which must touch you to do
         damage, inflicting 1 die damage of size (3 + (your level/3)).  You
         may also shoot them at a single creature for 3 dice damage of size
         (2 + (your level)/2, but you will then be unprotected until they
         regrow (in 8 rounds).
     13. Radiation Generation
         You can shoot a beam of radiation every 15 turns that is capable of
         causing damage to any creature in its path.  The damage done is 2
         dice of size (3 + (your level)/2).
     14. Reflective Skin
         Your Radiation Resistance is raised to somewhere in the range of
         19-23.  The damage you receive from laser attacks is halved, while
         you only receive 2/3 damage from heat attacks.
     15. Sonic Attack
         You are able to generate an ultrasonic blast that does heat damage to
         all creatures standing next to you.  The damage done is 1 die of size
         (5 + (your level)*1.5)
     16. Tenticles
         You can entwine a creature (which makes it harder for them to hit
         you, and impossible for them to run away) and cause constriction
         damage to them every round.  The damage done is 1 die of size
         (3 + (your level)/2), and you are able to do other things (like use
         your weapon or tech devices) while constricting.  If you move, the
         tenticles release.
     17. Tough Exoskeleton
         Your Armor Class is always at least as good as if you were wearing
         Titanium Chainmail, and you sustain only 80 percent normal damage
         from kinetic attacks.  You are slightly encumbered by this
         exoskeleton, but no more so than if you were wearing the equivalent
         armor.

  B. Mental Mutations
     1.  Cryogenics
         This attack mutation is particularly effective against powerful
         creatures.  It does exponential damage, first 1 die, then 2 dice,
         then 4, 8, 16 etc on progressive "hits".  The dice size is given by
         (5 + (your level)/2).
     2.  Force Field
         While this mutation is being used, you sustain reduced damage (in
         general, about 2/3 normal) from all attacks.  This can be tiring
         to use, and if you become too fatigued, it will turn itself off.
     3.  Heightened Willpower
         Your Mental Resistance is raised to somewhere in the range of 19-23,
         and you are able to periodically raise all of your stats and your
         hit points for a brief period.  Note that you will never die when
         your hit points are reduced back to normal.
     4.  Hypnosis
         You can use this mutation to put creatures to sleep.  This is usable
         fairly often, and can be a real asset when fighting several creatures
         at once, or when you want to flee.
     5.  Invisibility
         You can make yourself invisible, making creatures wander at random and
         enabling you to get off "free" attacks.  This is also useful when you
         need to retreat.  In addition, since this mutation is the ability to
         bend light rays around you, you are less susceptible to blindness
         attacks (you typically recover in one third the time).
     6.  Life Leech
         A powerful mutation, you are able to leech hit points from creatures
         standing next to you and add them to your own.  The number of points
         damage done (and subsequently added to your total) is 2 dice where
         the dice size is given by (2 + (your level)/2).
     7.  Mental Blast
         This mutation allows you to psionically blast a selected creature
         every 10 rounds up to 7 squares away.  The damage done is 2 dice
         of size given by (your Mental Resistance + your level)/2.
     8.  Mental Healing
         This mutation allows you to heal yourself rapidly.  When used, you
         select how many rounds you will sit motionless (and prone to attack),
         during which time you will heal back 3 hit points per round.  This
         mutation is best used after battles, so that you are always at full
         hit points when venturing into uncharted territory.
     9.  Military Genius
         You recieve a +2 to hit and +4 damage with all weapons you use.
         This includes contact and thrown weapons, and tech weapons as well.
     10. Molecular Disruption
         You can disintegrate matter, destroying a creature or other object
         at which it is targeted.  This is useful for going through walls,
         and will kill a creature if a random roll of dice size
         (25 + the creature's hit points/2) is less than a random roll of
         dice size (15 + your mental resistance + your level).
     11. Psychokinesis
         You can create a grenade-like explosion that does kinetic damage to
         all creatures in its blast radius.  The damage done is 2 dice of size
         (2 + (your mental resistance)/6 + (your level)/3 ).
     12. Scientific Genius
         Your Intelligence is raised to somewhere in the range of 19-23, and
         you are able to build new tech devices from parts and energy salvaged
         from old devices.  You are potentially able to build any device which
         you are familiar with (those listed when you press F3) and for which
         you have enough parts.  Often, you must try several times in order
         to be able to build the device you would like.
     13. Teleportation
         You are able to transport yourself over either long distances (useful
         as a speedy mode of transportation and as a means of escape) or short
         distances (useful when you want to get to another part of a castle
         level or lair).  Teleporting blind is dangerous, and if you end up
         inside a solid object, you may be killed.  It is occasionally an
         effective attack to teleport into a creature if you are at full hit
         points, but not one generally recommended.  Note that short range
         teleporting isn't 100% accurate, so if you try to teleport next to a
         castle wall, you may end up inside the wall, which tends to be
         unhealthy.

3.  BERRIES
Berries are named at random each game, so it is a waste of time to write
down the names during one game for the sake of using them in the next.  The
random names were intended to sound like Dr. Seuss names.

  A. Treatise on Berry Colors  (available from a Computer Workstation)
     The color of a berry reveals its degree of ripeness. The six colors
     a berry can have are red, orange, yellow,  green, blue, and purple,
     in increasing  order of ripeness.   Berries which are more ripe are
     more potent, and will have effects which last longer.  For example,
     purple exploding berries do much more damage than orange ones,  and
     forcefields created by blue  berries last longer than those created
     by red ones.  In addition, if a berry can have either a good or bad
     effect, the ripe berries are more likely to cause the good effects.
     Thus, a blue berry that alters speed tends to speed you up, while a
     red one is likely to slow you down.   Berries that alter your stats
     are particularly important examples of this, wherein red and purple
     ones change your stats permanantly, purple usually raising, and red
     usually lowering;  the effect of the orange-blue ones is temporary.
     Berries will ripen with time;  using  X(amine) can be illuminating.

  B. Berry descriptions
     Exploding berries are effective grenades with a blast radius of 1 square.
     Radiating berries are effective grenades with a blast radius of 1 square.
     Hunger-satisfying berries provide significant nourishment, and can make
        critters burp if thrown at them.
     Refresh berries make you well-rested and help keep you rested.
     Poison berries can be thrown to do poison damage if they hit a critter.
     Curing berries will restore some hit points, and some reduced by poison.
     Extra-curing berries are like normal curing berries, only more potent.
     Expertise-altering berries add or subtract experience points depending on
        their color.
     Strength-altering berries raise or lower strength, depending on color.
     Dexterity-altering berries raise or lower dexterity, depending on color.
     Constitution-altering berries raise or lower CON, depending on color.
     Radiation Resistance-altering berries modify RR, depending on color.
     Mental Resistance-altering berries modify MR, depending on color.
     Intelligence-altering berries modify intelligence, depending on color.
     Speed-altering berries will make you fast or slow, depending on color.
        These work on creatures, too, if thrown.
     Berries that toughen skin will permanantly lower your armor class.
        These work on creatures, too, if thrown.
     Intoxicating berries will confuse you if eaten, or a critter if thrown.
     Cleverness berries make you better at figuring out and using tech devices.
     Berries which add body parts are generally useless except for nourishment.
        Purple ones will cause you to grow a cumbersome udder.
     Mutation-affecting berries quench or heighten a mutation, depending on
        their color.  Heightened mutations are much more powerful.
     Detection berries help you see invisible things, and will map a lair
        or castle level if you are indoors.
     Blindness berries will blind you temporarily if eaten.
        These work on creatures, too, if thrown.
     Tact-reducing berries make you burp, sneeze, etc. if eaten.
        These work on creatures, too, if thrown.
     Mind-clouding berries make you forget things but will confuse creatures
        if thrown at them.
     Fright-inducing berries will frighten critters away temporarily.
     Detoxifying berries will remove the lingering adverse effects of poisons.
     Rambifying berries give you a Rambo complex, making you strong but dumb.
        These work on creatures, too, if thrown.

* Attack types:
Radiation damage is multiplied by 10 / (your radiation resistance)
Poison damage is multiplied by 10 / (your constitution)
Poison I simply does damage
Poison II has a chance to reduce your strength
Poison III has a chance to reduce your constitution and hit points
Mental Blast, Life Leech damage is multiplied by 10 / (your mental resistance)
Constrict attacks, once they hit, do damage every round thereafter
Energy Drain attacks can quench mutations or drain experience points

Some damage amounts are approximate;  for example, a Cactus has 5 separate
dart attacks for 1-6 each, with differing ranges, so it will only do the
maximum of 5-30 at close range.  Mental Blast damage amounts can vary widely
from those given.  Damage Armor and Steal/Eat attacks may do some damage if
they don't successfully damage armor / steal an item.

** resistances:
a:  resist acid
b:  resist blindness
c:  resist cold
e:  resist electricity
g:  grow from heat or laser attacks
h:  resist heat
i:  invisible
k:  take 1/3 damage from kinetic attacks
l:  resist lasers
m:  resist mental attacks
p:  resist poison
r:  resist radiation
s:  resist sneezing/burping
1:  regenerate 1 hit point/round
3:  regenerate 3 hit points/round
4:  regenerate 4 hit points/round
q4: quills or shock if touched for  1-4 points damage
q10: quills or shock if touched for 1-10 points damage
q14: quills or shock if touched for 2-14 points damage

*** susceptibilities
a:  double damage from acid
b:  double damage from blindness
c:  double damage from cold
e:  double damage from electricity
h:  double damage from heat
k:  double damage from kinetic
l:  double damage from lasers
m:  double damage from mental attacks
p:  double damage from poison
r:  double damage from radiation
s:  sluggish (only move every other round)

6.  CASTLES
  Your overall mission is to save the world from the Grinch and his nerve
toxin.  You must complete a series of missions in order to accomplish this
goal.  You do not need to visit these castles in any particular order, 
despite the suggestions of the Tape Recorders you'll find along the way.
You will usually need to visit 5 different castles in order to properly equip
yourself.  Specifically, you'll need the following items: 
1.  A map from the Munsters in order to locate the Grinch's hidden castle.
    All the Munsters are dangerous foes, Grampa in particular.  You need to
    use the teleport trap somewhere in the room with Grampa to get to the
    sealed room containing the map (as well as another teleport trap).  To
    render Grampa harmless, find the Green Gregre berry on Level -6 of the
    castle, the level before you get to the Munsters level.  This berry will
    turn you green for a short period of time, and all the Munsters will
    mistake you for Herman and consequently ignore you.
    Note:  a character with Heightened Vision shouldn't have to visit this
    castle at all.  Also, a JackHammer or Molecular Disruption makes the
    Gregre Berry unnecessary.
2.  Buzz Aldrin's Space Suit to protect yourself from the radiation which
    protects the Grinch's castle.  Buzz is protected by a variety of losers,
    the most dangerous of which are the 9 Chicago Cubs.  If you are wearing
    the Mets Hat which you can find in a secret room soon after entering
    Buzz's level, the Cubs are much less harmful.  Buzz is on the deepest
    level in his castle.
3.  Elvis' Blue Suede Shoes so you can cross the bottomless chasm that 
    surrounds the Grinch's castle.  Elvis is a good guy like you, but you
    have to get rid of all the Elvis Impersonators on his castle level with
    him before he'll give you the goods.  You can tell the difference between
    the real and fake Elvii be noting that when you wake them up and they
    sing the line of an Elvis song, only Elvis gets the words right.  If you
    wake the real Elvis before finishing off the Impersonators (ie, he
    doesn't immediately give you the stuff), run away from him and he'll fall
    back asleep fairly soon.  Elvis's special level may be on the top-most
    or the bottom-most level;  only a Tricorder can tell you ahead of time
    where he is.
4.  Donald Trump's Presidential ID card to get through the locked door into
    the castle.  Donald, Marla and Ivana all have nasty Life Leech attacks.
    If possible, try to have a MindWeb Generator or some Mental Resistance-
    enhancing berries available.  Donald is easier to deal with if you can
    find and defeat Ivana first (Donald tends to doze off like Elvis, by the
    way) and get her blonde wig (which will raise your Mental Resistance and
    lower your Intelligence by 15 while wearing it).  Donald is on the
    highest level of his castle.
5.  Gilligan's Keptibora serum to protect yourself from the nerve toxin which
    permeates the Grinch's castle.  Getting to this castle can be tricky, and
    if you find a WetSuit, Kayak, Rubber Raft, Hovercraft, Jetpack or 
    Transporter Monolith, try to proceed directly to this castle, which is
    always located in the middle of a body of water.  Gilligan is very
    dangerous to your belongings.  You should try to find and defeat the
    Skipper to retrieve his hat, which you'll hit Gilligan with.  Before
    going after Gilligan, it is wise to drop all your belongings since
    Gilligan has a knack for breaking things.  If you used a Transporter
    Monolith to get to this castle, be sure to grab the Bamboo Raft for
    return transportation.  Save the Keptibora Serum until you are ready to
    go to the Grinch's castle, since it only lasts for a single day.  Gilligan
    is on the highest level of his castle.

    The Grinch's castle can be very dangerous if you're unprepared.  The
Grinch's special level is either on the top-most or bottom-most level;
unless you have a Tricorder, you'll have a 50-50 chance of going the wrong
way.  Tech items won't work on the Grinch's special level, so begin collecting
useful berries on your way there.  Since the Grinch is surrounded by nasty
guardians, berries like Invisibility, Fright-Inducing, Speed-Enhancing are
especially useful.  You may want to save a Detox berry, too. Don't try to
defeat the Grinch in out-and-out combat; with his dying gasp he'll trigger
the release of the nerve toxin, sending doom upon the remains of the Earth.
Instead, go to the castle level furthest from the Grinch, (ie, the top-most
floor if he is on the bottom-most floor) where you can find a can of Roast
Beast.  Tossing this at the Grinch will cause his heart to grow 3 sizes, and
he'll destroy the toxin.
