alpman11.zip: AlphaMan version 1.1 for MS-DOS, by Jeff Olson.  A roleplaying
  game set in post-holocaust Earth.  You play a mutated human who must use a
  variety of technological relics and mutated berries to save the world from
  the Grinch's evil schemes.  Occasional humorous twists.  Game uses colorful 
  text-based graphics in the spirit of NetHack.  Requires 640K, color.

  Version 1.01 added a "fast fight" mode that speeds up combat, added 2 easier 
  modes of play for beginners, and made food more plentiful.

  Version 1.02 fixed a bug that caused unpredictable effects when one went
  from "very hungry" to "famished", and improved the effects of the mutations
  Invisibility, Quills and Heightened Endurance, to make them more powerful.

  Version 1.03 fixed saved filename convention so the game no longer dies when
  trying to save games with character names that include odd characters
  like ? and +.

  Version 1.1 allows the game to remember recent castle and lair levels, so
  remapping is no longer necessary.  For example, most dropped items will
  still be there when you return to a place already visited.
  Entering 'alphaman somename' will now generate a new character if the saved
  file somename.alf doesn't exist.
  There are now separate "Halls of the Dead" for the different difficulty
  levels, and experience bonuses at the end of the game for each "subquest"
  successfully completed.
  The Main Map key (F5) now shows regions where you've visited (useful for
  looking for Monoliths).
  A few new devices - Flash Grenade, UV Helmet, Geiger Counter, Neutron Suit,
  Radar Detector.
